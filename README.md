# FreshAlert ðŸ¥©âœ¨

**AI-powered food freshness detection for refrigeration enterprises**

FreshAlert automatically detects spoiled food before distribution, reducing waste and optimizing supplier performance through real-time AI analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem

Refrigeration companies storing food for months before distribution face:

- **High food waste** from undetected spoilage
- **Manual inspection** inefficiencies
- **No data** on supplier/line performance
- **Quality control** bottlenecks

## ðŸš€ Solution

- **ðŸ¤– AI Detection**: Custom VGG16 model with transfer learning classifies food as fresh/spoiled
- **ðŸ“Š Real-time Analytics**: Track performance by supplier and production line
- **ðŸ”„ Live Monitoring**: Conveyor belt visualization with instant decisions
- **ðŸ’¬ AI Assistant**: Query system data in natural language

## ðŸ§  AI Model Details

Our custom computer vision model leverages transfer learning for optimal performance:

- **Architecture**: VGG16 backbone with ImageNet pre-training
- **Training Strategy**: Two-phase approach (feature extraction + fine-tuning)
- **Input Size**: 128x128 RGB images for efficient processing
- **Performance**: Optimized with mixed precision (FP16) and GPU acceleration
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers, batch normalization, and early stopping
- **Class Balancing**: Weighted training to handle imbalanced datasets
- **Deployment**: TensorFlow Lite conversion for edge inference

**Training Process:**

1. **Feature Extraction**: Frozen VGG16 base with custom classifier head
2. **Fine-tuning**: Unfreezing last 8 layers for domain-specific adaptation
3. **Optimization**: Dynamic learning rate reduction and early stopping

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

**Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, TensorFlow Lite  
**Frontend**: React, Three.js, Real-time WebSockets  
**AI**: Custom VGG16 model, Computer Vision pipeline, Mixed Precision training

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Backend
cd Backend && pnpm install && node server.js

# Frontend
cd web && npm install && npm start

# App
cd App && pnpm install && pnpm run dev

# Database
psql -d database -f tables.sql
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Real-time conveyor belt monitoring** with 3D visualization
- **Automatic fresh/spoiled classification** using transfer learning
- **Performance analytics** per supplier and production line
- **AI chat assistant** for data queries
